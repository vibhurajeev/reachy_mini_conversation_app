## Overview
- Real-time audio conversation loop for low-latency streaming, powered by the **Hugging Face** realtime backend using the built-in Hugging Face server or your own local endpoint.
- Vision is handled by the realtime backend when the `camera` tool is used.
- Layered motion system queues primary moves (dances, emotions, goto poses, breathing) while blending speech-reactive wobble.
- Async tool dispatch integrates robot motion and camera capture. An optional web UI (`--ui`) provides personality selection, mic control, and settings.

## Architecture

The app follows a layered architecture connecting the user, AI services, and robot hardware:

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before using this app, you need to install [Reachy Mini's SDK](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy_mini/).<br>
> Windows support is currently experimental and has not been extensively tested. Use with caution.

<details open>
<summary><b>Using uv (recommended)</b></summary>

Set up the project quickly using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
uv venv --python /opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12 .venv

# Linux / Windows (Python in PATH)
uv venv --python python3.12 .venv

source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync
```

> **Note:** To reproduce the exact dependency set from this repo's `uv.lock`, run `uv sync --frozen`. This ensures `uv` installs directly from the lockfile without re-resolving or updating any versions.

Include dev dependencies:
```bash
uv sync --group dev
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Using pip</b></summary>

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

**Install dev dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -e .[dev]                   # Development tools
```

</details>

### Dependency groups

| Group | Purpose | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `dev` | Developer tooling (`pytest`, `ruff`, `mypy`) | Development-only dependencies. Use `--group dev` with uv or `[dev]` with pip. |

## Configuration

The default setup uses the Hugging Face backend and does not require an API key.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` when you want to point Hugging Face at your own local endpoint.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `REALTIME_TRANSCRIPTION_LANGUAGE` | Optional input transcription language for the realtime backend. Defaults to `en`; set to a backend-supported code such as `zh` for Chinese. |
| `HF_REALTIME_CONNECTION_MODE` | Hugging Face connection selector: `deployed` uses the built-in Hugging Face server; `local` uses `HF_REALTIME_WS_URL`. Defaults to `deployed`. |
| `HF_REALTIME_WS_URL` | Direct websocket endpoint for your own Hugging Face backend. Accepts either a base URL like `ws://127.0.0.1:8765/v1` or the full websocket URL `ws://127.0.0.1:8765/v1/realtime`. Used when `HF_REALTIME_CONNECTION_MODE=local`. |
| `HF_TOKEN` | Optional token for Hugging Face access (for gated/private assets). |
| `REACHY_MINI_APP_TIMEOUT_MINUTES` | Minutes of inactivity before Reachy goes to sleep and the app stops. Defaults to `1440` (one day); set to `0` to disable. |

### Hugging Face Connection Modes

Use the built-in Hugging Face server through the app-managed Space proxy. This is the default for a new install; set it explicitly only when you want to switch back from a saved local endpoint:

```env
HF_REALTIME_CONNECTION_MODE=deployed
```

Run your own realtime voice backend using [speech-to-speech](https://github.com/huggingface/speech-to-speech) on the same machine as the conversation app:

```env
HF_REALTIME_CONNECTION_MODE=local
HF_REALTIME_WS_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:8765/v1/realtime
```

Run your own Hugging Face backend on your laptop and connect to it from Reachy Mini Wireless over the same Wi-Fi network:

```env
HF_REALTIME_CONNECTION_MODE=local
HF_REALTIME_WS_URL=ws://<your-laptop-lan-ip>:8765/v1/realtime
```

For that LAN setup, make sure the backend listens on an address reachable from the robot, not only on `127.0.0.1`.

If the backend stays bound to loopback on your laptop, you can forward it into the robot over SSH instead:

```bash
ssh -N -R 8765:127.0.0.1:8765 <robot-user>@<robot-host>
```

Then set this on the robot:

```env
HF_REALTIME_CONNECTION_MODE=local
HF_REALTIME_WS_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:8765/v1/realtime
```

In the web UI's Settings view, the Connection section lets you choose either the built-in server or a local `host:port` target. The UI writes `HF_REALTIME_CONNECTION_MODE` for you, and the local path writes `HF_REALTIME_WS_URL` with a default of `localhost:8765`.

### Hermes gateway mode (this fork)

This fork adds a second backend where **all intelligence routes through a
[Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent)**: the app does
client-side VAD → local Whisper STT → HTTP/SSE to Hermes's `api_server` →
sentence-streamed local TTS, plus robot-action directives (`⟦emotion:happy⟧`)
parsed from the reply. The app runs on a server next to Hermes — the robot
(Reachy Mini Wireless) runs only the stock daemon, and the SDK connects over
the network automatically.

Setup, in order:

1. **Hermes VM** — enable the `api_server` platform, restrict the robot
   channel's toolset, and add the robot rules to `SOUL.md`:
   follow [docs/HERMES_VM_SETUP.md](docs/HERMES_VM_SETUP.md).
2. **Server app install** (same VM or any box that reaches both Hermes and the
   robot's LAN):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vibhurajeev/reachy_mini_conversation_app.git
   cd reachy_mini_conversation_app
   uv sync && uv pip install -r requirements-hermes.txt
   # Kokoro TTS model files (once):
   curl -LO https://github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx/releases/download/model-files-v1.0/kokoro-v1.0.onnx
   curl -LO https://github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx/releases/download/model-files-v1.0/voices-v1.0.bin
   ```
3. **Configure `.env`** (see the `Hermes gateway backend` block in
   `.env.example`): at minimum `CONVERSATION_BACKEND=hermes`,
   `HERMES_API_URL`, `HERMES_API_KEY`.
4. **Robot** — power on, on the same LAN; the daemon and `reachy-mini.local`
   discovery are stock behavior. Then run `reachy-mini-conversation-app` on
   the server. First run downloads the Whisper model (~500 MB for `small`).

The upstream Hugging Face backend remains the default
(`CONVERSATION_BACKEND=hf` or unset) and is unaffected.

## Running the app

Activate your virtual environment, then launch:

```bash
reachy-mini-conversation-app
```

> [!TIP]
> Make sure the Reachy Mini daemon is running before launching the app. If you see a `TimeoutError`, it means the daemon isn't started. See [Reachy Mini's SDK](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy_mini/) for setup instructions.

The app runs in console mode by default. Add `--ui` to also serve a web UI at http://127.0.0.1:7860/ for picking a personality, controlling the mic, and changing settings. All options are described in the CLI table below.

### CLI options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--no-camera` | `False` | Run without camera capture. |
| `--ui` | `False` | Serve the web UI at http://127.0.0.1:7860/, in addition to console mode. |
| `--robot-name` | `None` | Optional. Connect to a specific robot by name when running multiple daemons on the same subnet. See [Multiple robots on the same subnet](#advanced-features). |
| `--debug` | `False` | Enable verbose logging for troubleshooting. |

### Examples

```bash
# Audio-only conversation (no camera)
reachy-mini-conversation-app --no-camera

# Launch with the minimal web UI for personality/mic/settings control
reachy-mini-conversation-app --ui
```

## LLM tools exposed to the assistant

The default profile exposes these tools. Custom profiles can enable a different set in their own `tools.txt`.

| Tool | Action | Dependencies |
|------|--------|--------------|
| `dance` | Queue a dance from `reachy_mini_dances_library`. | Core install only. |
| `stop_dance` | Clear queued dances. | Core install only. |
| `play_emotion` | Play a recorded emotion clip via Hugging Face datasets. | Core install only. Uses the default open emotions dataset: [`pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-emotions-library`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-emotions-library). |
| `stop_emotion` | Clear queued emotions. | Core install only. |
| `camera` | Capture the latest camera frame and analyze it with the selected realtime backend. | Core install only. Requires the camera (disable with `--no-camera`). |
| `idle_do_nothing` | Explicitly remain idle during an idle turn. Not intended for normal conversation turns. | Core install only. |
| `move_head` | Queue a head pose change (left/right/up/down/front). | Core install only. |
| `head_tracking` | Follow the user's face with the head, or stop following. | Core install only. Requires a daemon with the `vision` extra and a camera. |
| `go_to_sleep` | Run Reachy's sleep movement and stop the current app after an explicit user request. | Core install only. |
| `sweep_look` | Sweep Reachy's head left, right, and back to center. | Bundled default profile tool. |
| `remember` | Save one short, stable fact about the user for future sessions. | Core install only. Stored in the app instance data directory. |
| `forget` | Remove a saved memory fact by matching a short query. | Core install only. |
| `pollen_robotics_reachy_mini_search_tool__search_web` | Search the web and return a short list of results. | Preinstalled MCP Space: `pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-search-tool`. |
| `pollen_robotics_reachy_mini_weather_tool__get_weather` | Report today's weather for a place: current conditions, high and low temperature, and rain chance. | Preinstalled MCP Space: `pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-weather-tool`. |
| `pollen_robotics_reachy_mini_time_tool__get_time` | Report the current time for a timezone or the user's local time, or the difference between two timezones. | Preinstalled MCP Space: `pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-time-tool`. |

> [!NOTE]
> `remember`/`forget` facts are stored in `memory.v1.json` inside the app's instance data directory (`~/.local/share/reachy_mini_conversation_app/` by default, or the instance path used by the desktop launcher). `forget` only removes facts matched by query. To reset all remembered facts, delete this file.

## Advanced features

Built-in motion content is published as open Hugging Face datasets:
- Emotions: [`pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-emotions-library`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-emotions-library)
- Dances: [`pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-dances-library`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-dances-library)

<details>
<summary><b>Custom profiles</b></summary>

Create custom profiles with dedicated instructions and enabled tools.

For normal usage, select a profile from the UI and save it for startup. That selection is persisted in `startup_settings.json`.

If no startup settings have been saved yet, you can still seed startup from the environment with `REACHY_MINI_CUSTOM_PROFILE=<name>` to load `profiles/<name>/`. If neither is set, the `default` profile is used.

Each profile should include `instructions.txt` (prompt text). If that file is missing or empty, the app logs a warning and falls back to `profiles/default/instructions.txt`. `greeting.txt` is optional and controls how the robot should start the conversation after the backend connects. `tools.txt` (list of allowed tools) is recommended. If missing for a non-default profile, the app falls back to `profiles/default/tools.txt`. Profiles can optionally contain custom tool implementations.

**Startup greeting:**

On startup, once the realtime backend is connected and ready, the app sends the active profile's `greeting.txt` as an internal text turn so the model opens with a fresh spoken greeting. Keep this file as a short instruction, not a fixed script, for example:
```
Greet me warmly in one sentence, in character, and vary the wording each time.
```
If `greeting.txt` is missing, the app uses the built-in default greeting prompt.

**Enabling tools:**

List enabled tools in `tools.txt`, one per line. Prefix with `#` to comment out:
```
play_emotion
# move_head

# My custom tool defined locally
sweep_look
```
Tools are resolved first from Python files in the profile folder (custom tools), then from the core library `src/reachy_mini_conversation_app/tools/` (like `dance`, `camera`).
Installed Hugging Face Space tools can also be enabled here after you add them with `tool-spaces`.

**Custom tools:**

On top of built-in tools found in the core library, you can implement custom tools specific to your profile by adding Python files in the profile folder.
Custom tools must subclass `reachy_mini_conversation_app.tools.core_tools.Tool` (see that module for the interface).

**Edit personalities from the UI:**

When running with `--ui`, the Home view lists available profiles (folders under `profiles/`) plus the built-in default:
- Tap a card to apply that personality and start talking.
- Tap "Custom" to create a new personality by entering a name, instructions, and an optional startup greeting prompt. It copies `tools.txt` from the `default` profile and stores the files under `user_personalities/<name>/` in the app instance directory (next to `.env`/`startup_settings.json`).

Note: switching a personality reloads its instructions and tools in place via a quick backend reconnect — no app restart. Editing the active profile's files on disk needs a re-select (or restart) to apply.

<details>
<summary><b>Locked profile mode</b></summary>

To create a locked variant of the app that cannot switch profiles, edit `src/reachy_mini_conversation_app/config.py` and set the `LOCKED_PROFILE` constant to the desired profile name:
```python
LOCKED_PROFILE: str | None = "mars_rover"  # Lock to this profile
```
When `LOCKED_PROFILE` is set, the app always uses that profile, ignoring saved startup settings, `REACHY_MINI_CUSTOM_PROFILE`, and the web UI. The UI shows "(locked)" and disables all profile editing controls.
This is useful for creating dedicated clones of the app with a fixed personality. Clone scripts can simply edit this constant to lock the variant.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>External profiles and tools</b></summary>

You can extend the app with profiles/tools stored outside the repository defaults.

- Core profiles are under `profiles/`.
- Core tools are under `src/reachy_mini_conversation_app/tools/`.

**Recommended layout:**

```text
external_content/
├── external_profiles/
│   └── my_profile/
│       ├── instructions.txt
│       ├── greeting.txt     # optional startup greeting prompt
│       ├── tools.txt        # optional (see fallback behavior below)
│       └── voice.txt        # optional
├── external_tools/
│   └── my_custom_tool.py
└── installed_tool_spaces.json
```

**Environment variables:**

Set these values in your `.env` when you want env-driven external profile/tool selection:

```env
# Optional fallback/manual profile selector:
REACHY_MINI_CUSTOM_PROFILE=my_profile
REACHY_MINI_EXTERNAL_PROFILES_DIRECTORY=./external_content/external_profiles
REACHY_MINI_EXTERNAL_TOOLS_DIRECTORY=./external_content/external_tools
# Optional convenience mode:
# AUTOLOAD_EXTERNAL_TOOLS=1
```

**Loading behavior:**

- **Default/strict mode**: `tools.txt` defines enabled tools explicitly. Every name in `tools.txt` must resolve to either a built-in tool (`src/reachy_mini_conversation_app/tools/`) or an external tool module in `REACHY_MINI_EXTERNAL_TOOLS_DIRECTORY`.
- **Convenience mode** (`AUTOLOAD_EXTERNAL_TOOLS=1`): all valid `*.py` tool files in `REACHY_MINI_EXTERNAL_TOOLS_DIRECTORY` are auto-added.
- **External profile fallback**: if the selected external profile has no `tools.txt`, the app falls back to built-in `profiles/default/tools.txt`.
- **Duplicate safety**: every loaded tool class must expose a unique `Tool.name`. The app now fails fast if two tool implementations claim the same tool name.

This supports both:
1. Local external tools used with built-in/default profile.
2. Local external profiles used with built-in default tools.

<details>
<summary><b>Hugging Face Space tools</b></summary>

You can install MCP-compatible Hugging Face Spaces as remote tool sources for this app. Private Spaces work too, as long as `HF_TOKEN` is set (or you have run `hf auth login`) for an account that can access them.

```bash
# install + enable in active profile
reachy-mini-conversation-app tool-spaces add <owner/space-name>

# enable in a specific profile
reachy-mini-conversation-app tool-spaces add <owner/space-name> --profile NAME

# install without enabling
reachy-mini-conversation-app tool-spaces add <owner/space-name> --install-only

# list installed spaces
reachy-mini-conversation-app tool-spaces list

# remove an installed space
reachy-mini-conversation-app tool-spaces remove owner/space-name
```

The bundled Pollen Spaces are enabled by default and resolve from static specs, so startup needs no Hugging Face discovery. For custom Spaces, the app validates the slug through the Hugging Face Hub, probes the standard MCP endpoint (sending the HF token only to private Spaces), discovers tools, enables them in the active profile's `tools.txt`, and writes the installed Space to:

- `installed_tool_spaces.json` in the managed app instance directory
- `external_content/installed_tool_spaces.json` in terminal mode

Recommended tags for discoverability on Hugging Face:

- `reachy-mini-tool`
- `mcp`

These tags are advisory only. Installation still relies on successful MCP validation, not on tag presence.

> [!NOTE]
> Preinstalled Pollen Spaces can be removed like any other (`tool-spaces remove pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-weather-tool`) or delete `installed_tool_spaces.json` to restore all defaults.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Multiple robots on the same subnet</b></summary>

If you run multiple Reachy Mini daemons on the same network, use:

```bash
reachy-mini-conversation-app --robot-name <name>
```

`<name>` must match the daemon's `--robot-name` value so the app connects to the correct robot.
